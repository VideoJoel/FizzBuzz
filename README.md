# FizzBuzz
The FizzBuzz project on Codecademy.

This is just a little problem/project called FizzBuzz.

The goal is to have the program print out the numbers 1-100.

However, every number that is a multiple of 3 prints as Fizz, every multiple of 5 prints out as Buzz, and multiples of both print as FizzBuzz.
